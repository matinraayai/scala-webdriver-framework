# Scala Selenium Webdriver Framework (SSWF)
## What is it?
This is a [Selenium Webdriver Framework](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) written in the 
[Scala](https://github.com/scala/scala) programming language. It lets its users utilize an
extended version of the famous [page object model](https://www.guru99.com/page-object-model-pom-page-factory-in-selenium-ultimate-guide.html)
without having to write ugly and boiler plate code by using a custom DSL describing the contents
of the page in a "human readable" way.

Unlike what its name implies, it allows the user to utilize other JVM-based HTML parsers like 
[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) and even introduce their own parser if they want.
